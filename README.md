Working on motor vehicle collision dataset

I decided to work on a NYC Data Collision Dataset because I want to get my drivers license soon and I thought it would be fun to explore different car crash statistics before I start driving.

The dataset is part of the NYC Opendata and it contains statistics on car crashes that happened in NYC. \
Link for the dataset is here: \

It is 2.08M rows and 29 columns. \
